/sandbox/test_numbers.py:10:1: E303 too many blank lines (4)
class NumbersTest(unittest.TestCase):
^
    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank
    lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank
    line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
    related functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
    related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical
    sections.

    Trailing whitespace is superfluous.

    The warning returned varies on whether the line itself is blank,
    for easier filtering for those who want to indent their blank lines.

/sandbox/test_numbers.py:33:81: E501 line too long (94 > 80 characters)
    # 43112603 --> forty three million, one hundred and twelve thousand, six hundred and three
                                                                                ^
    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to
    have several windows side-by-side.  The default wrapping on such
    devices looks ugly.  Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum
    of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or
    comments), limiting the length to 72 characters is recommended.

    Reports error E501.
